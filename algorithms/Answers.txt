b) O(n)

c)O(n^3)

d) O(n^2) 

e))O(n^4)

f) O(n)

g) O(n)


Excercise 3

a) If the smallest element is picked then O(n) = n ^ 2 since T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) <= n * T(n - 1) <= n * T(n) => O(n ^2)
b) If median is picked then O(n) = n log n, Since at each step the problem size reduces by half and this happens n times.
